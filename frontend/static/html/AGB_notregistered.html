<h3>7. Rights you Grant klicks.</h3>

    By creating an account, you grant to klicks a worldwide, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, right and license to
    host, store, use, copy, display, reproduce, adapt, edit, publish, modify and distribute information you authorize us to
    access from Facebook, as well as any information you post, upload, display or otherwise make available (collectively, “post”)
    on the Service or transmit to other users (collectively, “Content”). Klicks’ license to your Content shall be non-exclusive,
    except that klicks’ license shall be exclusive with respect to derivative works created through use of the Service. For example,
    klicks would have an exclusive license to screenshots of the Service that include your Content. In addition, so that klicks
    can prevent the use of your Content outside of the Service, you authorize klicks to act on your behalf with respect to
    infringing uses of your Content taken from the Service by other users or third parties. This expressly includes the authority,
    but not the obligation, to send notices pursuant to 17 U.S.C. § 512(c)(3) (i.e., DMCA Takedown Notices) on your behalf
    if your Content is taken and used by third parties outside of the Service. Our license to your Content is subject to
    your rights under applicable law (for example laws regarding personal data protection to the extent any Content contains
    personal information as defined by those laws) and is for the limited purpose of operating, developing, providing,
    and improving the Service and researching and developing new ones. You agree that any Content you place or that you authorize us to place on the Service may be viewed by other users
    and may be viewed by any person visiting or participating in the Service (such as individuals who may receive shared Content from other klicks users).
    </p>
    <p>You agree that all information that you submit upon creation of your account, including information submitted from your Facebook account,
        is accurate and truthful and you have the right to post the Content on the Service and grant the license to klicks above.
    <p>You understand and agree that we may monitor or review any Content you post as part of a Service. We may delete any Content,
        in whole or in part, that in our sole judgment violates this Agreement or may harm the reputation of the Service.
    <p>When communicating with our customer care representatives, you agree to be respectful and kind. If we feel that your
        behavior towards any of our customer care representatives or other employees is at any time threatening or offensive,
        we reserve the right to immediately terminate your account.
    <p>In consideration for klicks allowing you to use the Service, you agree that we, our affiliates, and our third-party
        partners may place advertising on the Service. By submitting suggestions or feedback to klicks regarding our Services,
        you agree that klicks may use and share such feedback for any purpose without compensating you.
    <p>You agree that klicks may access, preserve and disclose your account information and Content if required to do so by
        law or in a good faith belief that such access, preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary, such as to:
        (i) comply with legal process; (ii) enforce this Agreement; (iii) respond to claims that any Content violates the rights of third parties;
        (iv) respond to your requests for customer service; or (v) protect the rights, property or personal safety of the Company or any other person.
